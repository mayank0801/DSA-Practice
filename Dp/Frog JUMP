There is a frog on the 1st step of an N stairs long staircase. The frog wants to reach the Nth stair. HEIGHT[i] is the height of the (i+1)th stair.If Frog jumps from ith to jth stair, the energy lost in the jump is given by |HEIGHT[i-1] - HEIGHT[j-1] |.In the Frog is on ith staircase, he can jump either to (i+1)th stair or to (i+2)th stair. Your task is to find the minimum total energy used by the frog to reach from 1st stair to Nth stair.

If the given ‘HEIGHT’ array is [10,20,30,10], the answer 20 as the frog can jump from 1st stair to 2nd stair (|20-10| = 10 energy lost) and then a jump from 2nd stair to last stair (|10-20| = 10 energy lost). So, the total energy lost is 20.

int frogJump(int n, vector<int> &heights)
{
    // Write your code here.
    vector<int>dp(n+1,-1);
    dp[0]=0;
    for(int i=1;i<=n;i++){
        int x=dp[i-1]+abs(heights[i]-heights[i-1]);
        int y=1001;
        if(i>1){
             y=dp[i-2]+abs(heights[i]-heights[i-2]);
        }
        dp[i]=min(x,y);
    }
    return dp[n-1];
}
